I have developed a graph neural network reinforcement learning framework based on sub equivariant physical principles for equivalent representation, for coordinating motion control of multiple robots. This framework combines the learning of equivariant equivalent representations and graph network relationship inference, which can effectively capture the collaborative patterns of multi-agent systems and generate efficient coordinated control strategies based on this (ICRA2024). In my research on reinforcement learning, I also combine it with wavelet analysis to improve the quality of vital sign monitoring in patients with sleep disorders. By designing this novel reinforcement learning algorithm and using a reward and punishment mechanism to learn the optimal selection of wavelet bases, the ability to analyze patient physiological signals has been enhanced.

Computational Biomedical and Medical Engineering Interdisciplinary Learning
======
In this interdisciplinary research, I applied graph neural networks and multimodal fusion to automatically diagnose obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. I propose a multi-source heterogeneous graph fusion framework that can efficiently integrate multimodal clinical data and medical imaging data of patients, and based on this, perform accurate disease diagnosis and intelligent analysis (Complex&Intelligent Systems). In addition, I have designed a cross institutional knowledge transfer framework based on federated semi supervised representation learning to promote the collaborative utilization of medical big data and the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field (Knowledge-Based Systems).

Optimization of Large Language Model Representation and Exploration of Interactive Microscopic Molecular Properties
======
Since the popularization of big language models (GPT, LLAMA2, Claude), I have been passionate about researching the application of big models in areas such as algorithm optimization and interactive scientific understanding. To optimize the ability of large models to understand molecular structures, I propose a deep learning framework based on SMILES molecular formula to construct graph structure representations and promote the learning of large model understanding. This framework effectively integrates the modeling advantages of graph neural networks for molecular topological structures (COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE). In addition, through repeated experiments and optimization of algorithm logic, after targeted downstream task fine-tuning (Applied Intelligence) of LLAMA2, a large language model learning framework based on graph representation learning and semantic embedding was constructed for drug target affinity prediction task, hoping to promote the relevant progress of new drug research and development.

Multi Agent Collaboration and Deployment of Multivariate Sequential Task Allocation
======
I am very interested in studying collaborative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems. I have designed a novel framework for representation learning and relational reasoning based on the principle of graph invariance, which is used to efficiently capture the intention interaction patterns of multi-agent systems, providing solutions for tasks such as multi robot collaboration and drone formation (this research is actually similar to the first point). On the other hand, I have also established an attention space time series graph model for multivariate time series prediction, which can accurately depict the spatiotemporal correlation of complex systems and be applied in practical scenarios such as intelligent power scheduling and communication resource optimization.

Biomass Algorithm Modeling and Energy Applications
======
I have established a machine learning driven mathematical model for biomass pyrolysis process under the guidance of Professor Chen Bin from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After extensive experiments, we introduced model optimization logic algorithms into the big language model and constructed a new energy model (Fuel) that can efficiently extract knowledge from biomass pyrolysis parameters and process data, achieving precise simulation and optimization of biomass pyrolysis behavior.
